Whack-a-mole game for Elgato Stream Deck
Jack Mudge

Dependencies:
1. pip install streamdeck pillow
2. Follow the streamdeck library installation instructions, particularly
   for USB backend permissions. See:
    https://python-elgato-streamdeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/backend_libusb.html

3. Obviously, you will need a StreamDeck. This game assumes the first attached StreamDeck is the interesting one.
